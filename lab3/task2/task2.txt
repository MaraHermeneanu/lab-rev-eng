1. Run the program once and take note of any strings. Go to the .rodata segment (Ctrl-s) and find
any/all of the strings. Using the xref functionality, determine where the main() function is. (1p)

rodata -> xref string "Please input..." -> sub_401DE7  (main) -> xref to start


2. Rename all the functions in main() and determine the password-checking function. (1p)
3. In the password-checking function, observe how the correct password is generated; we want to
make this function more readable.

4.Go to the location of any word ..... variable in IDA-view and find the location of the start of the
alphabet and redeclare that address as a wide C string (Edit→Strings→Unicode).

5. Again, in the password checking function, observe how the right-hand side looks now. Redeclare
the alphabet with the “const” modifier at the beginning. This should collapse the function and
reveal the correct password. Finally, check that the password is accepted. (2p)
