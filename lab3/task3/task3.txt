1. Use the Structures tab and create the following list structure (also declare field 8 next as a
struc 1* pointer) (2p)

Ghidra -> right click create struct as
2. In main(), cast the buffer returned from malloc and the head of the list to this struct type and
propagate in the password checking function, renaming and retyping where necessary. (2p)
3. Describe what the code does and figure out the correct password. (2p)

Create a link list containing the alphabet backwards - from {, ascii 123, idx 26 to b, ascii 98, idx 1
The password check looks at the first 5 characters from the user input and traverses the linked list 
If a matching character is found the index gets saved -> later on checked against the right password character index (character idx + 97) which we can already see in the program
